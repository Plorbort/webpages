        <p>Hey Everyone my name is Alexander Putnam, I am a freshman at North Carolina State University. <br />
           As of right now, I am an Aerospace Engineering Intent with hopes of being accepted into the department next year! <br />
           I chose Aerospace because I want to be involved with aeronautics and have always had a fascination with space and planes since I was little. <br />
